Here are a few projects I have worked on during my internship:

Project 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Description: A machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. 

This classic dataset is often used to demonstrate the basics of machine learning and data classification.

Features:

📍Data preprocessing and cleaning

📍Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

📍Implementation of various classification algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine)

📍Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

📍Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Project 2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Description: This project involves analyzing unemployment data to understand trends and patterns over time. 

By leveraging Python's data analysis libraries, the project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting unemployment rates and identify potential solutions to mitigate unemployment.

Features:

📍Data collection from reliable sources such as government databases and public datasets

📍Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality

📍Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize unemployment trends over time and across different regions

📍Statistical analysis to identify key factors influencing unemployment rates

📍Time series analysis to forecast future unemployment trends

📍Presentation of findings through comprehensive visualizations and reports

Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook

Project 3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

Description: A machine learning project aimed at predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the

market value of a car, assisting sellers and buyers in making informed decisions.

Features:

📍Data collection from online sources and datasets containing car listings

📍Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, categorical data, and outliers

📍Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and car prices

📍Feature engineering to create new relevant features and improve model performance

📍Implementation of various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

📍Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared

📍Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

📍Deployment of the model using a web framework for user interaction

Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask/Django (for deployment)
