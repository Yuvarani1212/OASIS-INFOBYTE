Here are a few projects I have worked on during my internship:

Project 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Description: A machine learning project aimed at classifying iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. 

This classic dataset is often used to demonstrate the basics of machine learning and data classification.

Features:

📍Data preprocessing and cleaning

📍Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

📍Implementation of various classification algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine)

📍Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

📍Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance

Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Project 2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Description: This project involves analyzing unemployment data to understand trends and patterns over time. 

By leveraging Python's data analysis libraries, the project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting unemployment rates and identify potential solutions to mitigate unemployment.

Features:

📍Data collection from reliable sources such as government databases and public datasets

📍Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data quality

📍Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize unemployment trends over time and across different regions
📍Statistical analysis to identify key factors influencing unemployment rates
📍Time series analysis to forecast future unemployment trends
📍Presentation of findings through comprehensive visualizations and reports
Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook


[Project 3: Predictive Maintenance](link to project)
Description: Developed a predictive maintenance model to predict equipment failures using historical maintenance data. This project involved feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
[Project 4: Sentiment Analysis](link to project)
Description: Built a sentiment analysis model to analyze customer reviews and feedback. This project included data preprocessing, text analysis, and model building.
Technologies: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn
[Project 5: Dashboard Development](link to project)
Description: Created interactive dashboards to visualize key performance indicators and business metrics. This project helped improve decision-making processes within the company.
Technologies: Tableau, Power BI
